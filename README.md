## Sparse Matrix<br>[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/lucianobajr/AEDS-TPS/tree/master/TP1)

In computer programming, a matrix can be defined with a 2-dimensional array. Any array with 'm' columns and 'n' rows represent a m X n matrix. There may be a situation in which a matrix contains more number of ZERO values than NON-ZERO values. Such matrix is known as sparse matrix.

## Knaspack Problem<br>[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/lucianobajr/AEDS-TPS/tree/master/TP2)

The knapsack problem or rucksack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items.<br><br>

Practical work 3 is based on three main data structures: word, text, and library. A word is composed of characters, a text is composed of words, and a library is composed of texts, each of which is structured. developed with linked lists and array. The objective of this work is to create a random word generation algorithm and thus sort a text in alphabetical order and a library from the number of words each text has.
* The group chose to implement the Select Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Heap Sort algorithms for both text and library with array.
* The group tried to implement the Select  Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Insert Sort  algorithms for both text and library with linked lists.
